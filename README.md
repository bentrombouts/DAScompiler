# DAScompiler
Official DAS-compiler repository

IMPORTANT NOTICE!!

it is important to know that this is a DAS testrelease

this means that ANY file using the DAScompiler WILL need to be called compilefile.extension

THE COMPILER WONT WORK OTHERWISE!

the compilefile.exstension WILL need to be in the same folder as the DAS-compiler!




INSTRUCTIONS:

1: rename your file you want to compile to compilefile.yourextension
2: download the right DAS-compiler for that extension
3: put the DAS-compiler and the compilefile in the same folder
4: you should get the compiledfile.yourassembly in the folder
IF THIS DOESNT HAPPEN, REPORT IT IMMEDIATLY.
I WILL INSTANTLY GO AND FIX IT
